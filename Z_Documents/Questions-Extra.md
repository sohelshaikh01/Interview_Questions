Great ‚Äî you're aiming for **10 more days of OOPs + memory-focused advanced concepts** followed by **5 project-building days around class-based designs**, all reinforcing JS mastery through **reusable, scalable, and real-world code**.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

---

## ‚úÖ **üîü Days: Advanced OOPs + Memory Mastery (Concept-Focused)**

Each day has **3 challenging questions or exercises** that push your conceptual boundaries.

---

### **Day 41: Advanced Class Composition vs Inheritance**

121. Implement a `NotificationService` using composition (`EmailSender`, `SMSSender`, `PushNotifier`).
122. Show why inheritance leads to tight coupling with a flawed `Animal ‚Üí Dog ‚Üí FlyingDog` hierarchy.
123. Refactor the above using composition (favor `canFly`, `canBark` traits/mixins).

---

### **Day 42: Prototypes & Memory Efficiency**

124. Create a class `Person` with a `greet()` method ‚Äì move it to prototype and explain memory benefit.
125. Simulate 10,000 users and track memory difference if `greet()` is inline vs prototype-based.
126. Extend built-in prototype (`Array.prototype.sum`) and handle edge cases.

---

### **Day 43: Garbage Collection & Closures**

127. Show a memory leak using closures inside event listeners.
128. Simulate scope chain memory retention with nested closures.
129. Fix the leak by removing references and using `WeakMap`.

---

### **Day 44: Encapsulation & Access Control**

130. Simulate private class variables using closures or `#` syntax.
131. Create a `BankAccount` class with `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, balance privacy.
132. Add validation (e.g., no negative deposit) using private methods.

---

### **Day 45: Dependency Injection & Loose Coupling**

133. Create a `PaymentProcessor` class that takes a `paymentGateway` (Stripe/PayPal) as param.
134. Switch implementation at runtime.
135. Simulate inversion of control (IoC) for better testability.

---

### **Day 46: Object Pooling Pattern**

136. Create a `DatabaseConnectionPool` with max 5 connections.
137. Reuse connections if idle, or wait if all are busy.
138. Simulate memory usage with/without pooling in concurrent scenario.

---

### **Day 47: Design Patterns ‚Äì Singleton, Factory, Observer**

139. Implement a Singleton for a `Config` class.
140. Build a Factory for creating different `Shape` objects.
141. Implement Observer pattern for an `EventBus`.

---

### **Day 48: Advanced `this`, bind, arrow vs function**

142. Explain difference of `this` in arrow vs normal function in a class method.
143. Implement manual `bind()` and simulate `call()` context usage.
144. Use arrow functions inside a constructor and contrast with normal function in memory trace.

---

### **Day 49: Prototype Chain Customization**

145. Create a `Vehicle` constructor with prototype.
146. Link `Car` ‚Üí `Vehicle`, override `start()`, and call super `start()` via prototype.
147. Visualize the full prototype chain and use `Object.getPrototypeOf()`.

---

### **Day 50: Memory Optimization Case Study**

148. Simulate large dataset filtering using generator functions.
149. Use `WeakSet` and `WeakMap` for managing user sessions without memory leaks.
150. Explain how event loop + microtask queue can lead to memory problems and race conditions.

---

## üß± **5 Extra Days: Class-Based Mini Projects (Realistic OOP Design)**

Each day has a **project (1 main class + supporting ones)** with a **core functionality explanation**.

---

### **Day 51: `FileManager` Utility Class**

* **Features**:

  * Read/write JSON or CSV
  * Check file stats
  * Batch rename or delete files

* **Concepts**: fs module, error handling, encapsulation.

---

### **Day 52: `SessionManager` for Authentication**

* **Features**:

  * Generate JWT tokens
  * Validate and auto-expire sessions
  * Support refresh tokens

* **Concepts**: Singleton, encryption, private methods.

---

### **Day 53: `CacheManager` with Expiry Logic**

* **Features**:

  * In-memory cache store
  * Expiry TTL
  * LRU optional feature

* **Concepts**: Map, closure-based expiry timers, weak references.

---

### **Day 54: `JobScheduler` with Queueing**

* **Features**:

  * Schedule tasks with delays or intervals
  * Pause/resume/cancel
  * Priority-based execution

* **Concepts**: Observer pattern, EventEmitter, closures.

---

### **Day 55: `AnalyticsTracker`**

* **Features**:

  * Log clicks, pageviews, scroll depth
  * Store in memory ‚Üí batch send to backend
  * Flush on tab close

* **Concepts**: Debouncing, batching, localStorage fallback.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

### You now have:

* üîü **Days (41‚Äì50)** ‚Üí Deep OOP + Memory questions with patterns, GC, optimizations.
