Great! Here’s a **remixed, beginner-friendly 15-Day Plan** where topics reappear 3–4 times at **increasing difficulty**, and **related concepts are paired** to enhance real-world coding understanding.

### 🔁 Key Points:

* Topics recur every 3–4 days (spaced revision).
* Each day includes **3 practical exercises**, focusing on coding + debugging.
* Exercises are **progressive**: from fundamentals to real app use.
* Concepts are grouped meaningfully: e.g. Accessibility + Images, Build + CI, DB + Security, etc.

---

### ✅ **Day 4 – Performance + Build (Level 1)**

**Topics:** Core Web Vitals, Tree Shaking

1. Run Lighthouse on your app and document LCP, CLS.
2. Enable tree shaking by removing unused component imports.
3. Use React’s `lazy()` + `Suspense` for code-splitting.
   → *Understand metrics and save bundle weight.*

---

### ✅ **Day 5 – CI/CD & Testing (Level 1)**

**Topics:** Automation, NPM Scripts, Testing

1. Write NPM scripts for build, lint, test.
2. Add a GitHub Action: run test on push.
3. Write your first Jest test for a utility function.
   → *CI basics + intro to testing mindset.*

---

### ✅ **Day 6 – Security + Auth (Level 1)**

**Topics:** Security, Authentication

1. Create login/signup form with password hashing using bcrypt.

   → *Foundations of secure auth.*

---

### ✅ **Day 7 – Real-time + Retry (Level 1)**

**Topics:** WebSocket, SSE, Polling

1. Setup a WebSocket server with simple chat broadcast.
2. Create fallback to polling when WS fails.
3. Implement retry with exponential backoff.
   → *Live systems start here.*

---

### ✅ **Day 8 – Database + Security (Level 2)**

**Topics:** SQL, Token Security

1. Add a `sessions` table and relate to `users`.
2. Store refresh tokens securely (HttpOnly cookie).
3. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection.
   → *Real DB design + secure flows.*

---

### ✅ **Day 9 – Accessibility + Testing (Level 2)**

**Topics:** Accessibility, Cypress

1. Write Cypress tests to navigate form using keyboard only.
2. Use `axe-core` plugin to detect accessibility issues.
3. Build a modal with ARIA roles + focus trap.
   → *Test and improve accessibility in practice.*

---

### ✅ **Day 10 – Performance + CI (Level 2)**

**Topics:** Performance Debug, CI/CD

1. Setup React Profiler to detect re-renders.
2. Optimize slow components using `React.memo`.
3. Add CI deploy flow to Netlify/Vercel with GitHub Actions.
   → *Speed + continuous feedback loop.*

---

### ✅ **Day 11 – Images + Lazy Load (Level 2)**

**Topics:** Responsive Image Strategy

1. Replace all hero images with CDN-loaded `srcset` images.
2. Lazy load below-the-fold components with IntersectionObserver.
3. Serve WebP format when browser supports.
   → *Save bandwidth and time.*

---

### ✅ **Day 12 – Build Optimization (Level 2)**

**Topics:** Bundle, Cache, Tools

1. Analyze bundle using `source-map-explorer`.
2. Setup long-term caching with hashed filenames.
3. Compare webpack vs esbuild (optional switch).

---

### ✅ **Day 13 – Testing + Mocks (Level 2)**

**Topics:** Jest, MSW, Cypress

1. Mock API calls using MSW in unit and UI tests.
2. Snapshot test a complex component.
3. Cypress: test login flow with token mock.
   → *Full stack test coverage.*

---

### ✅ **Day 14 – Real-time + Resilience (Level 2)**

**Topics:** Real-time, Backoff

1. Build a dashboard showing live API prices using polling + WS fallback.
2. Add auto-reconnect and notify on failure.
3. Refactor with abstraction for push/poll strategies.
