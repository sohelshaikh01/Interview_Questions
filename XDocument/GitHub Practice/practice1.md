Perfect! Here’s a **step-by-step guide with Git commands** to mimic a **professional GitHub workflow**, including working with branches, making pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts — just like in real-world software teams.

---

### 🔧 1. **Clone the Repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

---

### 🌱 2. **Create a New Branch for Your Work**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

> Use meaningful branch names like `feature/login-page` or `fix/navbar-bug`.

---

### 📁 3. **Make Changes / Upload Files**

Add files or edit existing ones.

Then stage and commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature or made changes"
```

---

### 🚀 4. **Push Your Branch to GitHub**

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

---

### 🔀 5. **Create Pull Request on GitHub**

* Go to your repo on GitHub.
* You’ll see a “Compare & pull request” button. Click it.
* Review your changes and create the PR (pull request) to `main` or another base branch.

---

### 👥 6. **Review & Merge PR (after approval or self-check)**

On GitHub:

* Review your PR
* Click **Merge pull request**
* Then delete the feature branch (optional)

---

### 🔄 7. **Update Local Main and Sync**

After merging, switch to main and pull updates:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

---

### 💥 8. **Handle Merge Conflicts (Simulated)**

If working on the same file in two branches:

```bash
# In branch A
git checkout -b conflict-test
# Make change in file1.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Change in conflict-test branch"
git push origin conflict-test

# Then switch back to main and make another change in the same file
git checkout main
# Edit file1.txt differently
git add .
git commit -m "Conflicting change in main"
git push origin main

# Now try to merge conflict-test into main
git merge conflict-test
```

You'll see a merge conflict. Resolve it in the file manually (look for `<<<<<<< HEAD` etc.), then:

```bash
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
git push origin main
```

---

### 🔄 9. **Pull Changes Made by Others**

Always keep your branch updated:

```bash
git checkout your-branch
git pull origin main  # or whatever base branch
```

---

### 🧹 10. **Clean Up Old Branches**

```bash
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name           # local delete
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name  # remote delete
```

---

### ✅ Real-World Tips

* Use `git status` often.
* Keep branches small and focused.
* Squash commits (`git rebase`) for clean history (optional but pro-level).
* Use `Draft PRs` for work-in-progress.

Would you like a script that simulates this whole process locally for practice?
